# SBA 320H - React Web Application Project

## StreamFlix Movie App

###  User situation
My partner and I always have weekly movie nights and we're starting to run out of movies to watch. So, I thought about creating an app where I can search for movies and see their summaries. Also, likely create an app to help schedule the movie nights with what movie we'll be watching.

### Project Overview:
The project aims to develop a dynamic movie website that utilizes APIs to fetch movie data such as titles, ratings, reviews, and trailers from external sources. The website will provide users with a platform to browse, search, and discover information about movies. Key features include a user-friendly interface, search functionality, movie details pages, user reviews, and integration with popular movie databases via APIs.

### Project Objectives:
Develop a visually appealing and user-friendly website interface.
Integrate API(s) to fetch movie data dynamically.
Implement search functionality to allow users to find movies easily.
Create movie details pages with comprehensive information including synopsis, ratings, trailers, and cast.
Enable user registration and authentication.
Allow registered users to rate and review movies.
Implement responsive design for mobile and desktop devices.
Ensure security measures are in place to protect user data.
Project Plan:

### Project Initiation Phase:
Define project scope, objectives, and requirements.
Identify APIs to be used for fetching movie data.
Set up project management tools and communication channels.

#### Design Phase:
Design wireframes and user interface mockups.
Plan the database schema for storing user data and movie information.
Define the architecture of the website and API integration.

#### Development Phase:
Set up the development environment.
Implement frontend using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript frameworks (e.g., React, Angular, Vue.js).
Integrate APIs to fetch movie data and display it on the website.
Develop search functionality to allow users to search for movies.
Create movie details pages with dynamic content fetched from APIs.
Implement user registration, authentication, and profile management.
Enable users to rate and review movies.

#### Testing Phase:
Conduct unit testing for individual components.
Perform integration testing to ensure seamless interaction between frontend and backend.
Test website responsiveness across various devices and browsers.
Perform security testing to identify and address vulnerabilities.
Gather feedback from users and stakeholders for improvements.

#### Deployment Phase:
Prepare the website for deployment to a production environment.
Configure server infrastructure and database setup.
Deploy the website and APIs to the production server.
Perform final checks to ensure everything is functioning correctly.

#### Maintenance Phase:
Monitor website performance and user feedback.
Address any bugs or issues reported by users.
Regularly update movie data fetched from APIs.
Implement feature enhancements based on user feedback and industry trends.

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:
- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
